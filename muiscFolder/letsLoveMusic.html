<h1> History of Music </h1>

<p> Music has been in the world since the beginning of time and has seen many changes throughout time. Music has gone through an evolution from the bible days to now in 2019. Music has very common in religious services and also can be find in the bible such as Psalms 150, Revelation 14:3-4 and Psalms 98:1-7. The styls of music has also changed to know what we know as pop, jazz, gospel, rock, and many others. Music is the only things that has changed with the times and has been good and bad in most cases. Music has also had instruments dating back to ancient times that have been long forgotten to instruments that are used in marching bands, concert bands, orchestras, and many others. </p>

<h1> Why Music is My Passion </h1>

<div class="passion">
<p> Music is my passion because when I listen or sing or dance to music, I escape into a totally differnet world where I can just let music take control. Another reason music is my passion is because I remember growing up with music in my house and I loved it ever since. The final reason music is my passion is because I am a musician and I play the trumpet and I've been playing the trumpet since I was 15 and I was able to get a band scholarship to the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff where I will be a music major this fall. Music has the power to make people feel good and that's why music is my passion. </p>

<h1> The Purpose Of Music </h1>

<div id="purpose">
    <p> The Purpose of Music is to express and modulate emotions. We use it to soothe, psych up, woo, enrage, sadden and cheer each other, or ourselves. Music is an especially important tool for bonding with and caring for infants. They may not understand the semantic content of language, but they understand the emotional content of music just fine. In preliterate societies, music was also essential as a mnemonic device. It's much easier to remember information if it's in song form. Even now, if we have to remember a phone number or address, we usually unconsciously sing it to ourselves. Music also serves as a way to perform to an audience of one one 1 million whether it be playin an instrument or singing. </p>
